From Rat to Driver
<br>
Born in the dark Rat had a dream. She wanted to see the light. However, the only way to do so was to drive ehr parents car out, but none of them knew how. After long hours sneaking to the library and painstakingly studying she finally learned how to drive. The image above is from her first drive out into the light.
